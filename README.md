# Credit Card Fraud Detection System

Welcome to the "Credit Card Fraud Detection System" project! Whether you're a student delving into the world of data science or an enthusiast eager to explore the practical applications of machine learning, you're in the right place. This project is tailored to introduce you to the intriguing realm of fraud detection by guiding you through the process of building a system to identify fraudulent transactions in credit card data.

## Project Overview

In this project, you'll learn how to:

- Load and understand the credit card transaction dataset, a well-known dataset in the financial industry.
- Preprocess and prepare the data for model training.
- Select appropriate features and algorithms for fraud detection.
- Train and evaluate your machine learning model.
- Interpret the results and assess the model's performance in identifying fraudulent transactions.
