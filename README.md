# Codsoft_task5

Joining CodSoft as a Data Science Intern, I embarked on a dynamic mission: crafting an advanced Credit Card Fraud Detection system. Armed with Python prowess and insatiable curiosity, I mastered data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques.

I wrangled extensive credit card transaction data, meticulously refining it for analysis. Creative feature engineering breathed life into our dataset, empowering it to discern genuine from fraudulent activities.

With machine learning magic, I fine-tuned algorithms from logistic regression to cutting-edge Gradient Boosting.

Validation and testing sealed the deal. I honed a solution that thrived on real-world data. My journey, encapsulated on GitHub, showcases a fledglingâ€™s dedication to foiling fraud through innovative data science.
